{"name":"Gistguide.github.io","tagline":"getting to know what are github gists","body":"##What we can do with Github Gist. \r\n\r\n###1. Write Text Anonymously\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to create an account at Github to use Gists. Just go to gist.github.com, write any block of text in the space provided and create a Gist. You can choose to have a secret Gist that will not be visible to search engines but only to those who know the URL of that secret Gist.\r\n\r\n###2. Track Changes like a Wiki\r\n\r\nWhen you edit the content of a Gist that has already been published, the previous versions of the Gist are also preserved. You can hit the Revisions tab to track edits made over time and there’s a built-in diff engine that will visually highlight the changes between any two versions of a gist. This can also be used for comparing text files.\r\n\r\n###3. Publish Gists in Rich Text\r\n\r\nWhile gists only accept plain text, you can use the Markdown format to publish your text in rich HTML format. You can add lists, images (hosted externally) and even Tables that are not supported in the original Markdown specification. When you are done writing the text in Markdown, remember to save the file with a .md extension.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to Markdown basics - https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics\r\n\r\n###4. Gist as a Writing Platform\r\n\r\nWhile there exist plenty of writing engines — from Blogger to Medium to Tumblr — you can also Github’s Gist service to quickly publish your writings on the web. Create a Gist either in plain text or markdown format and then use https://roughdraft.io to publish that Gist as a standalone web page. It’s like integrating Readability with your Gists. And you can use emoji (smileys) too!\r\n\r\n###5. Host Single Page Websites on Gist\r\n\r\nBl.ocks is one of the most interesting applications built for Gists. You can write your HTML, CSS and JavaScript code in plain text, save the Gist as index.html and then use http://bl.ocks.org/ to serve the rendered version of that HTML web page as it should appear in the browser. For instance, here’s a live version http://bl.ocks.org/labnol/raw/122d4de95c6a127b1c9b/ of an HTML file that is hosted on gist.github.com.\r\n\r\nThere are bandwidth constraints obviously but bl.ock.org is still an excellent tool for hosting your HTML through Gists. The other alternative is Google Drive.\r\n\r\n###6. Maintain a Task List\r\n\r\nYou can use Gists to keep track of pending tasks (see example). The tasks are written in a special syntax in plain text but they are rendered as a list of check boxes.\r\n\r\n- [x] Pick the flowers\r\n- [ ] Call John 9303032332\r\n- [x] Cancel cable subscription\r\n- [ ] Book the flight tickets\r\n\r\nYou can check or uncheck the items and the source text will update automatically. If your Gist is public, anyone can see your to-do lists but only the gist owner can change the status of individual tasks.\r\n\r\n###7. Gist as a Web Clipper\r\n\r\nThe GistBox add-on for Google Chrome lets you save text snippets from web pages as public or private gists. You can even add labels, or #hashtags, to your gists making discovery easier.\r\n\r\nP.S. - Mozilla Firefox is still cool :) \r\n\r\n###8. Embed Gists in Web Pages\r\n\r\nYou can embed any Gist in your web pages with a line of JavaScript code. The embedded Gists maintain all the formatting and syntax highlighting and visitors to your website can easily clone (or fork) your Gist into their own Github accounts. There’s also a plugin http://wordpress.org/plugins/oembed-gist/ and shortcode http://en.support.wordpress.com/gist/ for embedding Gists in WordPress blogs.\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/username/gist-id.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n###9. Measure the Traffic\r\n\r\nYou can use Google Analytics to measure the traffic to your Gists. Since Github does not allow JavaScript code to run inside plain text Gists, we can use the GA Beacon https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon to log visits in real-time to Gists.\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your Gists, save in Markdown format and it will add a transparent tracking image to your Gists.\r\n\r\n    ![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-XXXXX-X/gist-id?pixel)\r\n\r\n###10. Manage Gists from the Desktop\r\n\r\nGisto is free desktop application that lets you manage your Gists outside the browser. You can search Gists, edit the content of gists, view revisions over time and also share Gists. The app is available for Mac OSX, Windows and Linux. The other alternative is GistBox which is a web app.\r\n\r\n###Source - http://www.labnol.org/internet/github-gist-tutorial/28499/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
